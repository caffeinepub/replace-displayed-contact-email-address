  "missing_requirements": [
    {
      "requirement": "Add a Terms & Conditions section within the existing single-page layout, using the deep-link id \"terms\" (and without creating a separate Terms & Conditions page/route).",
      "reason": "No application/UI/layout files were modified; the only change is to `project_state.json`, which does not add or render any Terms & Conditions section.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest is specifically about adding a Terms & Conditions section and explicitly lists no requirements for these other features; the diff only reflects these unrelated feature descriptions.",
