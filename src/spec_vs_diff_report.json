  "summary": "The implementation successfully covers most requirements with Internet Identity authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, Stripe checkout, order history, contact details in footer, and warm earth tone design. However, several acceptance criteria have gaps or partial implementation, particularly around order status progression (only Pending/Completed/Failed vs. Pending/Processing/Shipped/Delivered), payment failure page evidence, and cart persistence verification.",
