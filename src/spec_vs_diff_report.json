  "summary": "The diff clearly adds the required canonical link tag in `frontend/index.html` and updates the custom-domain setup documentation to present `https://pccomputerandcommunication.com` as the primary URL while noting the IC-provided URL remains available. However, the diff summary does not provide evidence that all user-visible frontend references (UI text/links) that previously pointed to the IC-provided URL were updated to the custom domain, nor can it confirm that navigation/hash scrolling behavior remains unbroken.",

      "reason": "The diff includes documentation updates and the canonical tag, but does not show any concrete frontend UI text/link changes (e.g., in `Header`, `Hero`, `Footer`, etc.) that replace IC-provided URLs with the custom domain. From the provided diffs, only `frontend/DOMAIN_CONNECTION_INSTRUCTIONS.md` and `frontend/index.html` content is evidenced.",
