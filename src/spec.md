# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Build a full-stack e-commerce platform for computer products with user authentication, product catalog, shopping cart, Stripe checkout, and order tracking.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for secure user login and session management
- Create product catalog system with categories (desktops, laptops, components, peripherals) and pre-populate with 8-10 sample computer products
- Build shopping cart functionality with add/update/remove items and persistent cart for logged-in users
- Integrate Stripe payment processing with checkout page collecting shipping address and contact information
- Implement order tracking system with status progression (Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered)
- Display contact details (phone: 9315906829, email: panerudaya11@gmail.com) in footer with clickable links
- Apply warm earth tones with terracotta accents and modern typography for cohesive visual design

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse computer products, add items to cart, securely checkout with Stripe payment, and track their order status through a visually cohesive e-commerce platform.
