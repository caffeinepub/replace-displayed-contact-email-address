## Summary
**Goal:** Build a complete computer product e-commerce platform with user authentication, admin product management, shopping cart, Stripe checkout, and order tracking.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for secure login/logout
- Create admin panel for adding, editing, and deleting computer products (name, description, price, category, image)
- Build shopping cart system with add/remove items, quantity adjustment, and price calculation
- Implement checkout flow with shipping information collection and contact details display (phone: 9315906829, email: panerudaya11@gmail.com)
- Integrate Stripe payment processing with test mode support
- Create order tracking system with status progression (Pending → Processing → Shipped → Delivered)
- Display product catalog organized by categories with images, descriptions, and prices in INR
- Apply modern, professional tech retail design with cohesive color scheme and clean typography

**User-visible outcome:** Users can browse computer products by category, add items to cart, securely check out with Stripe payments, and track their orders through delivery. Admins can manage the product catalog through a dedicated panel. All interactions require Internet Identity authentication.
